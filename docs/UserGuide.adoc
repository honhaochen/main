Well, _TravEzy_ has got you covered. Simply inform _TravEzy_ of your schedule (your _commitments_, _school breaks_, public _holidays_ and _trips_) and _TravEzy_ will suggest periods of time when you can travel! Excited to find out more? Well... Read on!

=== Interface

This is how _TravEzy's calendar_ looks like:

image::calendarScreenshots/calendarInterfaceUG.png[Calendar interface,width=800]

{nbsp}

To help you easily differentiate between various types of _events_, _TravEzy_ has categorised the _events_ into four types: _commitment_, _holiday_, _school break_ and _trip_. Visually, _TravEzy_ also uses different _labels_ for the different types of _events_, as shown in the image above.

WARNING: The _labels_ indicate the *type* of _event_ you have for that particular day. It does not indicate the number of _events_.

=== Adding an event to your calendar: ``add``

Whew! After reading so much, it is time to find out how you can add your _event_ so that _TravEzy_ can start suggesting when you can travel! üòä

=== Checking your availability for a trip: ``check``

Do you need to find out whether you are available to go for a trip? You can get _TravEzy_ to find that out for you (i.e. when you happen to have a _school break_/_holiday_ *and* do not have any _commitment_/_trip_).

Let's find out how!

*Format:* +
``check d/START DAY [m/START MONTH] [y/START YEAR] [D/END DAY] [M/END MONTH] [Y/END YEAR]``

*Examples:*
****
* To check whether you are available on 9 December 2019,

    check d/9 m/Dec y/2019

image::calendarScreenshots/check2.png[Check result,width=600]


=== Suggesting a suitable time for a trip: ``suggest``

The end of the semester is near. It is time to look for some cheap flightsüõ´! However, before deciding which flight to book, you need to find out when you can travel. Need some help with that? No worries! _TravEzy_ has got you covered. üòä

How so? Just ask _TravEzy_ to suggest a suitable time!

*Format:* +

*Examples:*
****
* To find out when you can travel between 9 and 20 December 2019,

    suggest d/9 m/Dec y/2019 D/20 M/Dec Y/2019

image::calendarScreenshots/suggest2.png[Suggest result,width=600]

== Itinerary

Now that you have booked your flight, it's time to start planning your trip using _TravEzy's_ Itinerary.

In _TravEzy_, we have broken down your events into 6 key parts, namely _Title_, _Date_, _Time_, _Location_,
_Description_ and _Tag_.

For example, here is an Itinerary entry about our trip to Japan

. _Title_ -> Visit Tokyo DisneySea
. _Date_ -> 12122019
. _Time_ -> 1000
. _Location_ -> DisneySea
. _Description_ -> Remember to take pictures with the Disney Mascots!
. _Tag_ -> Priority: Critical

In the Itinerary, you will be able to add, delete, edit, list and show your entries. There are also a few more special
tasks that you can do with your Itinerary. Read on to find out more! üòä

=== Interface

This is how _TravEzy's_ Itinerary looks like:

image::ItineraryInterface.png[width=800]

=== Auto-completion feature

Don't you wish there's a way to quickly type all your commands. Well _TravEzy's_ Itinerary got you covered! _TravEzy's_
Itinerary _command box_ has auto-completion function which offers suggestions based on your input.

This is how _TravEzy's_ Itinerary auto-complete looks like:

image::ItineraryAuto.png[width=600]

1. _Auto-complete dropdown bar_. Provides suggestions to complete your command base on your current input typed in the
_command box_.

[WARNING]
The _auto-complete dropdown bar_ requires some time to sync with the input typed in the command box. Hence, give some time for
it to read the input before hitting _Enter_

=== Adding an event: ``add``

Planning to visit DisneySea tomorrow? Add some rides that you plan to take then! üé¢

*Format:*

``add title/TITLE date/DATE time/TIME [l/LOCATION] [d/DESCRIPTION]``

*Example:*

    add title/Ride DisneySea Electric Railway date/12122019 time/1500 l/DisneySea

*Step by step:*

Step 1. Type ``add title/Ride DisneySea Electric Railway date/12122019 time/1500 l/DisneySea`` in the _command box_.

Step 2. Remember to prioritize your events using the _Priority dropdown box_, to one of the 5 different priorities:

. Priority: None
. Priority: Low
. Priority: Medium
. Priority: High
. Priority: Critical

After selecting the priority for the event, press _Enter_.

image::ItineraryDelete2.png[width=600]

=== Editing an event: ``edit``

Rather than deleting an event when you have a change of plans, why not edit the details of the event instead?

*Format:*

``edit INDEX [title/TITLE] [date/DATE] [time/TIME] [l/LOCATION] [d/DESCRIPTION] [tag/]``

[TIP]
If you wish to edit the tag field in the event, indicate it with the prefix ``tag/`` and use the _Priority Dropdown Box_
to select the new priority.

    edit 4 title/Explore DisneySea's Aquatopia d/Take photos of the fishes tag/

*Step by step:*

Step 1. Type ``edit 4 title/Explore DisneySea's Aquatopia d/Take photos of the fishes tag/`` in the _command box_.

Step 2. If you indicate a change of the priority in the edit command using ``tag/``, do remember to select the new priority using
the _Priority Dropdown Box_.

image::ItineraryEdit1.png[width=600]

Step 3. The _result box_ will display the message "Updated successfully! :D
HAND, TrazEzy~"

Step 4. _TravEzy's_ Itinerary will showcase the new _event list_ with the edited event.

image::ItineraryEdit2.png[width=600]
